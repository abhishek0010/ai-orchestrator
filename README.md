# claude-setup

Portable Claude Code configuration: agents, slash commands, and language standards.  
Works with any project — TypeScript, Python, Flutter, Swift, C++.

```

## How it works

The core workflow is a pipeline triggered by `/implement`:

```
planner → coder → build check → reviewer(s) → verdict
```

- **planner** — detects the project language, reads standards, explores the codebase, writes `.claude/context/task_context.md`
- **coder** — reads the context file, calls a local Ollama model to generate code
- **reviewer** — reviews the diff against language standards via Ollama, returns APPROVED or NEEDS CHANGES

All code generation runs through local Ollama models, not Claude API tokens.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI installed
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running

### Ollama models

Pull the required models:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b-instruct-q4_K_M   # main code generation
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b                      # code review
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:1.5b                    # quick fixes, commits
ollama pull qwen3:8b                              # planning fallback, docs
ollama pull nomic-embed-text                      # semantic search
```

The `install.sh` script will offer to pull these automatically.

## Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/Projects/claude-setup
cd ~/Projects/claude-setup
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The script creates symlinks from `~/.claude/` into this repo, so a `git pull` is enough to update everything — no reinstall needed.

### What install.sh does

1. Creates `~/.claude/` if it doesn't exist
2. Backs up any existing files to `~/.claude/backups/`
3. Creates symlinks: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/agents/`, `~/.claude/commands/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/settings.json`
4. Adds `commit` shell alias to `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`)
5. Optionally pulls Ollama models

### Shell alias

`install.sh` adds a `commit` command to your shell that runs the commit agent directly via Haiku — no Sonnet overhead:

```bash
commit   # stage all changes and commit, from any git repo
```

After install, run `source ~/.zshrc` to activate it in the current terminal.

## Usage

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/implement` | Full plan → code → build → review pipeline |
| `/review` | Check current `git diff` against language standards |
| `/debug` | Analyze an error or stack trace |
| `/commit` | Stage and commit changes |

Claude also responds to natural language:
- "commit"  → runs commit agent
- "implement" → runs /implement
- "write docs" → runs doc-writer agent

## IDE Agent (Antigravity/Gemini) Delegation Workflow

This repository also supports native IDE-embedded agents (like Antigravity or Gemini) that act as an **Architect and Reviewer**. 

Instead of routing through bash hooks and markdown aliases, the IDE embedded agent will:
1. Act as the **Planner**, forming isolated context chunks (`/tmp/context.md`).
2. Delegate heavy generation (like large code writing or documentation writing) to local Ollama via:
   `python3 ~/Projects/claude-setup/call_ollama.py --model qwen2.5-coder:14b --prompt "implement X" --context-file /tmp/context.md`
3. Act as the **Reviewer**, validating the Ollama output against language standards, and safely applying it to the open IDE session.
- **Code generation**: `qwen2.5-coder:14b`
- **Documentation**: `qwen3:8b` 

## IDE Agent Delegation Workflow (Antigravity)

*Note: The core Claude Code workflow (with `/implement`, hooks and `.md` agents) remains fully intact and works exactly as described above. The following process applies exclusively to embedded IDE agents (such as Antigravity).*

When working with an IDE-embedded agent (like Antigravity), it acts as the Architect and Reviewer directly within the editor. Instead of using the Markdown agent pipeline, it works by:
1. Creating an isolated task context file (e.g., `/tmp/context.md`).
2. Delegating heavy code/documentation generation to the local Ollama model via terminal:
   `./call_ollama.sh --model qwen2.5-coder:14b --prompt "implement X" --context-file /tmp/context.md`
   *(For documentation, `qwen3:8b` is used).*
3. Receiving the clean textual response, reviewing it against the standards in `/skills/`, and securely applying the code directly into the active IDE session.

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/Projects/claude-setup
git pull
```

Changes apply immediately — no reinstall needed.
