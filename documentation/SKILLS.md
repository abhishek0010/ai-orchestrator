# Skills Registry

This document serves as a comprehensive index of all specialized skills available to the AI Orchestrator. Skills define coding standards, architectural patterns, and operational expertise.

## How Skills Work

1. **Auto-detection**: For programming languages, skills are loaded automatically based on indicator files in the project root.
2. **Contextual Loading**: For specialized tasks (e.g., "deploy", "optimize"), agents load the relevant skill manually or via trigger rules defined in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
3. **Task Context**: The planner reads the required skill and embeds its core rules into the `task_context.md`.
