## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **What is the exact relationship between `Skill: TypeScript Mastery` and `Plugin: api-architect`?**
  _Edge tagged AMBIGUOUS (relation: conceptually_related_to) - confidence is low._
- **Why does `Documentation CLAUDE.md (Orchestrator Guide)` connect `Community 2` to `Community 1`, `Community 3`, `Community 4`, `Community 6`, `Community 10`, `Community 11`, `Community 16`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.195) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `Architect Agent` connect `Community 4` to `Community 0`, `Community 10`, `Community 6`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.118) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `Skill: Security Hardening (OWASP)` connect `Community 4` to `Community 0`, `Community 1`, `Community 2`, `Community 5`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.115) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Are the 5 inferred relationships involving `Skill: Security Hardening (OWASP)` (e.g. with `Authentication Patterns Skill` and `Code Review Excellence Skill`) actually correct?**
  _`Skill: Security Hardening (OWASP)` has 5 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
